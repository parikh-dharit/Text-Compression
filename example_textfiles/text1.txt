The direct model turned out to have other benefits that even Michael Dell couldn’t have
anticipated when he founded his company. “You actually get to have a relationship with the
customer,” he explains. “And that creates valuable information, which, in turn, allows us to
leverage our relationships with both suppliers and customers. Couple that information with
technology, and you have the infrastructure to revolutionize the fundamental business
models of major global companies.”
In this interview with HBR editor-at-large Joan Magretta, Michael Dell describes how his
company is using technology and information to blur the traditional boundaries in the value
chain among suppliers, manufacturers, and end users. In so doing, Dell Computer is evolving
in a direction that Michael Dell calls virtual integration. The individual pieces of the strategy—
customer focus, supplier partnerships, mass customization, just-in-time manufacturing—may all be familiar. But Michael Dell’s insight into how to combine them is highly innovative:
technology is enabling coordination across company boundaries to achieve new levels of
efficiency and productivity, as well as extraordinary returns to investors. Virtual integration
harnesses the economic benefits of two very different business models. It offers the
advantages of a tightly coordinated supply chain that have traditionally come through
vertical integration. At the same time, it benefits from the focus and specialization that drive
virtual corporations. Virtual integration, as Michael Dell envisions it, has the potential to
achieve both coordination and focus. If it delivers on that promise, it may well become a new
organizational model for the information age.
How has Dell pioneered a new business model within the computer industry?
If you look back to the industry’s inception, the founding companies essentially had to create
all the components themselves. They had to manufacture disk drives and memory chips and
application software; all the various pieces of the industry had to be vertically integrated
within one firm.
So the companies that were the stars ten years ago, the Digital Equipments of this world, had
to build massive structures to produce everything a computer needed. They had no choice
but to become expert in a wide array of components, some of which had nothing to do with
creating value for the customer.
As the industry grew, more specialized companies developed to produce specific
components. That opened up the opportunity to create a business that was far more focused
and efficient. As a small start-up, Dell couldn’t afford to create every piece of the value chain.
Consider a component like a graphics chip. Five or ten years ago, a whole bunch of companies
in the personal computer industry were trying to create their own graphics chips. Now, if
you’ve got a race with 20 players that are all vying to produce the fastest graphics chip in the
world, do you want to be the twenty-first horse, or do you want to evaluate the field of 20 and
pick the best one?
It’s a pretty simple strategy, but at the time it went against the dominant, “engineering-
centric” view of the industry. The IBMs and Compaqs and HPs subscribed to a “we-have-to-
develop-everything” view of the world. If you weren’t doing component assembly, you
weren’t a real computer company. It was like a rite of passage. You somehow proved your
who just fixed your computer?” The vast majority think that person works for us, which is
just great. That’s part of virtual integration.
Aren’t you just outsourcing your after-sales service? Is what you’re describing fundamentally
different from outsourcing?
Outsourcing, at least in the IT world, is almost always a way to get rid of a problem a company
hasn’t been able to solve itself. The classic case is the company with 2,000 people in the IT
department. Nobody knows what they do, and nobody knows why they do it. The solution—
outsource IT to a service provider, and hopefully they’ll fix it. But if you look at what happens
five years later, it’s not necessarily a pretty picture.
That’s not what we’re doing at all. We focus on how we can coordinate our activities to create
the most value for customers.
With our service providers, we’re working to set quality measures and, more important, to
build data linkages that let us see in real time how we’re doing—when parts are dispatched,
for instance, or how long it takes to respond to a request for service. We look at our business
and see, for example, that over the next ten years we are going to be making lots of notebook
computers. Dell might need 20 million flat-panel displays, and some years there will be more
demand than supply. Other years, there will be more supply than demand. A few companies
are currently making multibillion-dollar investments in the manufacture of these displays.
So we cook up a little deal where the supplier agrees to meet 25% of our volume requirements
for displays, and because of the long-term commitment we make to them, we’ll get our
displays year in and year out, even when there’s more demand than supply. The supplier
effectively becomes our partner. They assign their engineers to our design team, and we start
to treat them as if they were part of the company. For example, when we launch a new
product, their engineers are stationed right in our plants. If a customer calls in with a
problem, we’ll stop shipping product while they fix design flaws in real time.
Figuring out how many partners we need has been a process of trial and error. You learn
when you operate on the cutting edge of technology that things don’t always work as
planned. The rule we follow is to have as few partners as possible. And they will last as long as
they maintain their leadership in technology and quality. This isn’t like the automobile
business, where you find a tire supplier that you will probably stick with forever. Where the
technology is fairly stable—in monitors, for example—we expect our partnerships to last a
long time. Others will be more volatile. But regardless of how long these relationships last,
virtual integration means you’re basically stitching together a business with partners that are
treated as if they’re inside the company. You’re sharing information in a real-time fashion.
We tell our suppliers exactly what our daily production requirements are. So it’s not, “Well,
every two weeks deliver 5,000 to this warehouse, and we’ll put them on the shelf, and then
we’ll take them off the shelf.” It’s, “Tomorrow morning we need 8,562, and deliver them to
door number seven by 7 a.m.”I think about it this way: Assets collect risks around them in one form or another. Inventory is
one risk, and accounts receivable is another risk. In our case—with 70% of our sales going to
large corporate customers—accounts receivable isn’t hard to manage because companies like
Goldman Sachs and Microsoft and Oracle tend to be able to pay their bills. But in the
computer industry, inventory can actually be a pretty massive risk because if the cost of
materials goes down 50% a year and you have two or three months of inventory versus 11
days, you’ve got a big cost disadvantage. And you’re vulnerable to product transitions, when
you can get stuck with obsolete inventory.
nventory velocity is one of a handful of key performance measures we watch very closely. It
focuses us on working with our suppliers to keep reducing inventory and increasing speed.
With a supplier like Sony, which makes very good, reliable monitors, we figure there’s no
need for us to have any inventory at all. We are confident in putting the Dell name on them,
and they work fine. We don’t even take these monitors out of the box to test them because
we’ve gotten them to under 1,000 defects per million. So what’s the point in having a monitor
put on a truck to Austin, Texas, and then taken off the truck and sent on a little tour around
the warehouse, only to be put back on another truck? That’s just a big waste of time and
money, unless we get our jollies from touching monitors, which we don’t.
So we went to Sony and said, “Hey, we’re going to buy two or three million of these monitors
this year. Why don’t we just pick them up every day as we need them?” At first, it’s a little
confusing to the suppliers because you’re saying, “Now listen carefully. If you will help us get
your product from the end of your line to our customer faster, we won’t have any in our
warehouse.” And the suppliers look at you like you’re crazy and not making any sense.
They’re used to delivering in larger quantities, so at first they think this means you’re going to
buy less from them. And then the lightbulb goes on, and they realize we’ll be buying more
because we’ll be taking it faster.We tell Airborne Express or UPS to come to Austin and pick up 10,000 computers a day and go
over to the Sony factory in Mexico and pick up the corresponding number of monitors. Then
while we’re all sleeping, they match up the computers and the monitors, and deliver them to
the customer. Of course, this requires sophisticated data exchange. Most people are familiar with the way a
company like Black & Decker uses information links with the thousands of retailers that sell
its products. When a customer in Omaha buys a drill from his local hardware store, the system
immediately tells Black & Decker to send another unit of that particular drill to that particular
store. So their system has to replenish supply, unit by unit, to thousands of outlets. From the
supplier’s point of view, Dell is dramatically simpler. Our orders are typically for thousands of
units, and they need to go to only one of three manufacturing centers: Austin, Ireland, and
Malaysia. It’s almost ideal from a supplier standpoint because we have real-time information
on what the demand is, and all the supplier has to do is get the product to us.
And because we build to our customers’ order, typically, with just five or six days of lead
time, suppliers don’t have to worry about sell-through. We only maintain a few days—in some
cases a few hours—of raw materials on hand. We communicate inventory levels and
replenishment needs regularly—with some vendors, hourly. The typical case in our industry is the factory building 10,000 units a day, day in and day out.
First the machines stack up in the warehouse, and then they stack up in the channel. And all
of a sudden, the guy at the end of the chain hollers, “Whoa, hey, we’ve got too many of these.
Everybody stop!” And the order to stop flows back through the chain until it reaches every
component supplier. It’s literally stop and start, because if you have a 90-day lag between the
point of demand and the point of supply, you’re going to have a lot of inefficiency in the
process. And the more inventory and time you have, the more variability, and the more
problems.In our industry, there’s a lot of what I call bad hygiene. Companies stuff the channel to get rid
of old inventory and to meet short-term financial objectives. We think our approach is better.
We substitute information for inventory and ship only when we have real demand from real
end customers.
How does the direct model benefit your suppliers?
We can go to Sony and say, “We’re going to be pulling monitors from you in a very consistent,
predictable way because the distance between the demand and the source of supply is totally
shrunk.” The longer that distance, the more intermediary channels you add, the less likely it
is you will have good information about demand—so you will end up with more variability,
more inventory, higher costs, and more risk.
Another factor that helps keep our demand for computers level is the mix of customers we
serve. We don’t have any customer that represents more than 1% to 2% of our revenues. One
week Exxon is buying, the next week Shell is buying, the next week Ford is buying. But all
companies don’t decide in unison, “Well, this week we’re going to buy, next week we’re not.”
You mention your customer mix. Does the direct model imply a particular customer strategy?
When you’re trying to target profitable segments, averages obscure a lot, and aggregate
financial statements are pretty meaningless. Our approach to segmentation is to take really
big numbers and “de-average” them. Until you look inside and understand what’s going on
by business, by customer, by geography, you don’t know anything. This is a lesson we learned
the hard way. We incorrectly entered the retail business in 1989, thinking that our direct
business wouldn’t grow enough, and went into computer superstores and warehouse clubs.
But when we really started to understand the segment’s profitability, we realized we’d made
a mistake, and so we exited.For years, we didn’t actively pursue the consumer market because we couldn’t reach our
profit objectives. So we let our competitors introduce machines with rock-bottom prices and
zero margins. We figured they could be the ones to teach consumers about PCs while we
focused our efforts on more profitable segments. And then, because we’re direct and can see
who is buying what, we noticed something interesting. The industry’s average selling price to
consumers was going down, but ours was going up. Consumers who were now buying their
second or third machines—who wanted the most powerful machines and needed less
handholding—were coming to us. And without focusing on it in a significant way, we had a
billion-dollar consumer business that was profitable. So we decided in 1997 that it was time
to dedicate a group to serving that segment.
Fast-Cycle Segmentation Dell’s rapid growth in recent years has been accompanied by ever
finer cuts at customer segmentation. This is an important element of Dell’s virtual integration
with customers. The finer the segmentation, the better able Dell is to forecast what its
customers are going to need and when. Dell then coordinates the flow of that strategic
information all the way back to its suppliers, effectively substituting information for
inventory.Segmentation gets us closer to them. It allows us to understand their needs in a really deep
way. This closeness gives us access to information that’s absolutely critical to our strategy. It
helps us forecast what they’re going to need and when. And good forecasts are the key to
keeping our costs down.We turn our inventory over 30 times per year. If you look at the complexity and the diversity
of our product line, there’s no way we could do that unless we had credible information about
what the customer is actually buying. It’s a key part of why rivals have had great difficulty
competing with Dell. It’s not just that we sell direct, it’s also our ability to forecast demand—
it’s both the design of the product and the way the information from the customer flows all
the way through manufacturing to our suppliers. If you don’t have that tight linkage—the
kind of coordination of information that used to be possible only in vertically integrated
companies—then trying to manage to 11 days of inventory would be insane. We simply
couldn’t do it without customers who work with us as partners.
We see forecasting as a critical sales skill. We teach our sales-account managers to lead
customers through a discussion of their future PC needs. We’ll walk a customer through every
department of his company, asking him to designate which needs are certain and which are
contingent. And when they’re contingent on some event, the salesperson will know what that
event is so he can follow up. We can do this with our large accounts, which make up the bulk
of our business. With smaller customers, we have real-time information about what they’re
buying from our direct telephone salespeople. And we can also steer them in real time, on the
phone, toward configurations that are available, so this is another way we can fine-tune the
balance between supply and demand. It’s part of it. There are so many information links between us and our customers. For
example, we can help large global customers manage their total purchase of PCs by selling
them a standard product. Then when the guy whose computer isn’t working calls in from
Singapore, the IT people don’t have to spend the first 30 minutes just figuring out what
configuration of hardware and software he’s using. Selling direct allows us to keep track of
the company’s total PC purchases, country by country—and that’s valuable information we
can feed back to them. We sometimes know more about a customer’s operations than they do
themselves. Close customer relationships have allowed us to dramatically extend the value we deliver to
our customers. Today we routinely load the customer’s software in our factory. Eastman
Chemical, for example, has their own unique mix of software, some of it licensed from
Microsoft, some of it they’ve written themselves, some of it having to do with the way their
network works. Normally, they would get their PCs, take them out of the box, and then some
guy carrying a walkie-talkie and diskettes and CD-ROMs would come to each employee’s desk
to hook the system up and load all that software. Typically, this takes an hour or two—and
costs $200 to $300—and it’s a nuisance.
Our solution was to create a massive network in our factory with high-speed, 100-megabit
Ethernet. We’ll load Eastman Chemical’s software onto a huge Dell server. Then when a
machine comes down the assembly line and says, “I’m an Eastman Chemical analyst
workstation, configuration number 14,” all of a sudden a few hundred megabytes of data
come rushing through the network and onto the workstation’s hard disk, just as part of the
progressive build through our factory. If the customer wants, we can put an asset tag with the
company’s logo on the machine, and we can keep an electronic register of the customer’s
assets. That’s a lot easier than the customer sending some guy around on a thankless mission,
placing asset tags on computers when he can find them. What happens to the money our customer is saving? They get to keep most of it. We could
say, “Well, it costs you $300 to do it, so we’ll charge you $250.” But instead we charge $15 or
$20, and we make our product and our service much more valuable. It also means we’re not
going to be just your PC vendor anymore. We’re going to be your IT department for PCs.
Boeing, for example, has 100,000 Dell PCs, and we have 30 people that live at Boeing, and if
you look at the things we’re doing for them or for other customers, we don’t look like a
supplier, we look more like Boeing’s PC department. We become intimately involved in
planning their PC needs and the configuration of their network.
It’s not that we make these decisions by ourselves. They’re certainly using their own people
to get the best answer for the company. But the people working on PCs together, both from
Dell and Boeing, understand the needs in a very intimate way. They’re right there living it and
breathing it, as opposed to the typical vendor who says, “Here are your computers. See you
later.”
We’ve always visited clients, but now some of our accounts are large enough to justify a
dedicated on-site team. Remember, a lot of companies have far more complex problems to
deal with than PC purchasing and servicing. They can’t wait to get somebody else to take care
of that so they can worry about more strategic issues.
So some of your coordination with customers is made possible through technology, but
there’s still a good measure of old-fashioned, face-to-face human contact?
Yes, that’s right. The idea is to use technology to free people up to solve more complicated
problems. For example, a customer like MCI can access our internal support tools on-line in
the same way our own technical-support teams do, saving time and money on both sides.
They simply go to dell.com, enter some information about their system, and they have
immediate access to the same information that we use at Dell to help customers. These tools
are used by internal help-desk groups at large companies as well as by individuals.
We’ve developed customized intranet sites called Premier Pages for well over 200 of our
largest global customers. These exist securely within the customers’ firewalls, and they give
them direct access to purchasing and technical information about the specific configurations
they buy from us. One of our customers, for example, allows its 50,000 employees to view
and select products on-line. They use the Premier Page as an interactive catalog of all the
configurations the company authorizes; employees can then price and order the PC they
want. They are happy to have some choice, and Dell and the customer are both happy to
eliminate the paperwork and sales time normally associated with corporate purchasing. That
frees our salespeople to play a more consultative role.
We also have developed tools to help customers set up their own customized versions of
dell.com. There are about 7,000 of these to date.
How else do you stay close to your customers? 
In these meetings, our senior technologists share their views on where the technology is
heading and lay out road maps of product plans over the next two years. There are also
breakout sessions and working groups in which our engineering teams focus on specific
product areas and talk about how to solve problems that may not necessarily have anything
to do with the commercial relationship with Dell. For example, Is leasing better than buying?
or How do you manage the transition to Windows NT? or How do you manage a field force of
notebook computers? People in businesses as dissimilar as Unilever and ICI can learn from each other because,
amazingly, they have very similar problems when it comes to PCs. And we send not only our
top technologists and engineers but also the real engineers, the people who usually don’t get
out to talk to customers because they’re too busy developing products. All of our senior
executives from around the company participate, spending time with the customer, listening
to how we’re doing. The ratio is about one Dell person to one customer. At our last session,
we had about 100 customers. And that helps us, as well, with our own demand forecasting. So we’re helping each other in
important ways. We hire a lot of people from other companies in the industry, and they tell us
that these meetings are unique.
Do you spend a significant amount of your time at these meetings?
I spend three days at each of them. They’re great events. In the normal course of our
business, I have lots of opportunity to talk to customers one on one, but there is something
much more powerful about this kind of forum. Customers tend to speak more openly when
they’re with their peers and they know we’re there and we’re listening.
At every Platinum Council, we review what they told us last time and what we did about it.
We keep an ongoing record of the issues. Let me give you a concrete example: A few years
ago, the engineers responsible for our desktops were operating on the theory that customers
really wanted performance from these products—the faster the better. But what the
customers actually said at the Platinum Councils was, “Yeah, performance, that’s okay. But
what I really want is a stable product that doesn’t change. Because if I’m trying to run a bank
or an airline, I don’t care if it’s 2% faster or 3% slower. What really matters is stability.” So our
engineers thought one thing, the customers thought another thing. It took the direct feedback
from the Platinum Councils to spotlight this failure to communicate. We responded by
building product with intergenerational consistency over many years. The same feedback has
helped shape the creation of our brands. For both our desktop and notebook businesses, we
created different brands designed to deliver greater stability to corporate customers, as
opposed to the fast technology changes that consumers demand.
Most of the managerial challenges at Dell Computer have to do with what we call velocity—
speeding the pace of every element of our business. Life cycles in our business are measured
in months, not years, and if you don’t move fast, you’re out of the game. Managing velocity is
about managing information—using a constant flow of information to drive operating
practices, from the performance measures we track to how we work with our suppliers.
Performance Metrics. At Dell, we use the balance sheet and the fundamentals of the P&L on a
monthly basis as tools to manage operations. From the balance sheet, we track three cash-
flow measures very closely. We look at weekly updates of how many days of inventory we
have, broken out by product component. We can then work closely with our suppliers so we
end up with the right inventory. When it’s not quite right, we can use our direct-sales model
to steer customers toward comparable products that we do have. So we use inventory
information to work both the front and back ends at the same time.
The direct model turned out to have other benefits that even Michael Dell couldn’t have
anticipated when he founded his company. “You actually get to have a relationship with the
customer,” he explains. “And that creates valuable information, which, in turn, allows us to
leverage our relationships with both suppliers and customers. Couple that information with

time, suppliers don’t have to worry about sell-through. We only maintain a few days—in some
cases a few hours—of raw materials on hand. We communicate inventory levels and
replenishment needs regularly—with some vendors, hourly. The typical case in our industry is the factory building 10,000 units a day, day in and day out.
First the machines stack up in the warehouse, and then they stack up in the channel. And all
of a sudden, the guy at the end of the chain hollers, “Whoa, hey, we’ve got too many of these.
Everybody stop!” And the order to stop flows back through the chain until it reaches every
component supplier. It’s literally stop and start, because if you have a 90-day lag between the
point of demand and the point of supply, you’re going to have a lot of inefficiency in the
process. And the more inventory and time you have, the more variability, and the more
problems.In our industry, there’s a lot of what I call bad hygiene. Companies stuff the channel to get rid
of old inventory and to meet short-term financial objectives. We think our approach is better.
We substitute information for inventory and ship only when we have real demand from real
end customers.
How does the direct model benefit your suppliers?
We can go to Sony and say, “We’re going to be pulling monitors from you in a very consistent,
predictable way because the distance between the demand and the source of supply is totally
shrunk.” The longer that distance, the more intermediary channels you add, the less likely it
is you will have good information about demand—so you will end up with more variability,
more inventory, higher costs, and more risk.
Another factor that helps keep our demand for computers level is the mix of customers we
serve. We don’t have any customer that represents more than 1% to 2% of our revenues. One
week Exxon is buying, the next week Shell is buying, the next week Ford is buying. But all
companies don’t decide in unison, “Well, this week we’re going to buy, next week we’re not.”
You mention your customer mix. Does the direct model imply a particular customer strategy?
When you’re trying to target profitable segments, averages obscure a lot, and aggregate
financial statements are pretty meaningless. Our approach to segmentation is to take really
big numbers and “de-average” them. Until you look inside and understand what’s going on
by business, by customer, by geography, you don’t know anything. This is a lesson we learned
the hard way. We incorrectly entered the retail business in 1989, thinking that our direct
business wouldn’t grow enough, and went into computer superstores and warehouse clubs.
But when we really started to understand the segment’s profitability, we realized we’d made
a mistake, and so we exited.For years, we didn’t actively pursue the consumer market because we couldn’t reach our
profit objectives. So we let our competitors introduce machines with rock-bottom prices and
zero margins. We figured they could be the ones to teach consumers about PCs while we
focused our efforts on more profitable segments. And then, because we’re direct and can see
who is buying what, we noticed something interesting. The industry’s average selling price to
consumers was going down, but ours was going up. Consumers who were now buying their
second or third machines—who wanted the most powerful machines and needed less
handholding—were coming to us. And without focusing on it in a significant way, we had a
billion-dollar consumer business that was profitable. So we decided in 1997 that it was time
to dedicate a group to serving that segment.
Fast-Cycle Segmentation Dell’s rapid growth in recent years has been accompanied by ever
finer cuts at customer segmentation. This is an important element of Dell’s virtual integration
with customers. The finer the segmentation, the better able Dell is to forecast what its
customers are going to need and when. Dell then coordinates the flow of that strategic
information all the way back to its suppliers, effectively substituting information for
inventory.Segmentation gets us closer to them. It allows us to understand their needs in a really deep
way. This closeness gives us access to information that’s absolutely critical to our strategy. It
helps us forecast what they’re going to need and when. And good forecasts are the key to
keeping our costs down.We turn our inventory over 30 times per year. If you look at the complexity and the diversity
of our product line, there’s no way we could do that unless we had credible information about
what the customer is actually buying. It’s a key part of why rivals have had great difficulty
competing with Dell. It’s not just that we sell direct, it’s also our ability to forecast demand—
it’s both the design of the product and the way the information from the customer flows all
the way through manufacturing to our suppliers. If you don’t have that tight linkage—the
kind of coordination of information that used to be possible only in vertically integrated
companies—then trying to manage to 11 days of inventory would be insane. We simply
couldn’t do it without customers who work with us as partners.
We see forecasting as a critical sales skill. We teach our sales-account managers to lead
customers through a discussion of their future PC needs. We’ll walk a customer through every
department of his company, asking him to designate which needs are certain and which are
contingent. And when they’re contingent on some event, the salesperson will know what that
event is so he can follow up. We can do this with our large accounts, which make up the bulk
of our business. With smaller customers, we have real-time information about what they’re
buying from our direct telephone salespeople. And we can also steer them in real time, on the
phone, toward configurations that are available, so this is another way we can fine-tune the
balance between supply and demand. It’s part of it. There are so many information links between us and our customers. For
example, we can help large global customers manage their total purchase of PCs by selling
them a standard product. Then when the guy whose computer isn’t working calls in from
Singapore, the IT people don’t have to spend the first 30 minutes just figuring out what
configuration of hardware and software he’s using. Selling direct allows us to keep track of
the company’s total PC purchases, country by country—and that’s valuable information we
can feed back to them. We sometimes know more about a customer’s operations than they do
themselves. Close customer relationships have allowed us to dramatically extend the value we deliver to
our customers. Today we routinely load the customer’s software in our factory. Eastman
Chemical, for example, has their own unique mix of software, some of it licensed from
Microsoft, some of it they’ve written themselves, some of it having to do with the way their
network works. Normally, they would get their PCs, take them out of the box, and then some
guy carrying a walkie-talkie and diskettes and CD-ROMs would come to each employee’s desk
to hook the system up and load all that software. Typically, this takes an hour or two—and
costs $200 to $300—and it’s a nuisance.
Our solution was to create a massive network in our factory with high-speed, 100-megabit
Ethernet. We’ll load Eastman Chemical’s software onto a huge Dell server. Then when a
machine comes down the assembly line and says, “I’m an Eastman Chemical analyst
workstation, configuration number 14,” all of a sudden a few hundred megabytes of data
come rushing through the network and onto the workstation’s hard disk, just as part of the
progressive build through our factory. If the customer wants, we can put an asset tag with the
company’s logo on the machine, and we can keep an electronic register of the customer’s
assets. That’s a lot easier than the customer sending some guy around on a thankless mission,
placing asset tags on computers when he can find them. What happens to the money our customer is saving? They get to keep most of it. We could
say, “Well, it costs you $300 to do it, so we’ll charge you $250.” But instead we charge $15 or
$20, and we make our product and our service much more valuable. It also means we’re not
going to be just your PC vendor anymore. We’re going to be your IT department for PCs.
Boeing, for example, has 100,000 Dell PCs, and we have 30 people that live at Boeing, and if
you look at the things we’re doing for them or for other customers, we don’t look like a
supplier, we look more like Boeing’s PC department. We become intimately involved in
planning their PC needs and the configuration of their network.
It’s not that we make these decisions by ourselves. They’re certainly using their own people
to get the best answer for the company. But the people working on PCs together, both from
Dell and Boeing, understand the needs in a very intimate way. They’re right there living it and
breathing it, as opposed to the typical vendor who says, “Here are your computers. See you
later.”
We’ve always visited clients, but now some of our accounts are large enough to justify a
dedicated on-site team. Remember, a lot of companies have far more complex problems to
deal with than PC purchasing and servicing. They can’t wait to get somebody else to take care
of that so they can worry about more strategic issues.
So some of your coordination with customers is made possible through technology, but
there’s still a good measure of old-fashioned, face-to-face human contact?
Yes, that’s right. The idea is to use technology to free people up to solve more complicated
problems. For example, a customer like MCI can access our internal support tools on-line in
the same way our own technical-support teams do, saving time and money on both sides.
They simply go to dell.com, enter some information about their system, and they have
immediate access to the same information that we use at Dell to help customers. These tools
are used by internal help-desk groups at large companies as well as by individuals.
We’ve developed customized intranet sites called Premier Pages for well over 200 of our
largest global customers. These exist securely within the customers’ firewalls, and they give
them direct access to purchasing and technical information about the specific configurations
they buy from us. One of our customers, for example, allows its 50,000 employees to view
and select products on-line. They use the Premier Page as an interactive catalog of all the
configurations the company authorizes; employees can then price and order the PC they
want. They are happy to have some choice, and Dell and the customer are both happy to
eliminate the paperwork and sales time normally associated with corporate purchasing. That
frees our salespeople to play a more consultative role.
We also have developed tools to help customers set up their own customized versions of
dell.com. There are about 7,000 of these to date.
How else do you stay close to your customers? 
In these meetings, our senior technologists share their views on where the technology is
heading and lay out road maps of product plans over the next two years. There are also
breakout sessions and working groups in which our engineering teams focus on specific
product areas and talk about how to solve problems that may not necessarily have anything
to do with the commercial relationship with Dell. For example, Is leasing better than buying?
or How do you manage the transition to Windows NT? or How do you manage a field force of
notebook computers? People in businesses as dissimilar as Unilever and ICI can learn from each other because,
amazingly, they have very similar problems when it comes to PCs. And we send not only our
top technologists and engineers but also the real engineers, the people who usually don’t get
out to talk to customers because they’re too busy developing products. All of our senior
executives from around the company participate, spending time with the customer, listening
to how we’re doing. The ratio is about one Dell person to one customer. At our last session,
we had about 100 customers. And that helps us, as well, with our own demand forecasting. So we’re helping each other in
important ways. We hire a lot of people from other companies in the industry, and they tell us
that these meetings are unique.
Do you spend a significant amount of your time at these meetings?
I spend three days at each of them. They’re great events. In the normal course of our
business, I have lots of opportunity to talk to customers one on one, but there is something
much more powerful about this kind of forum. Customers tend to speak more openly when
they’re with their peers and they know we’re there and we’re listening.
At every Platinum Council, we review what they told us last time and what we did about it.
We keep an ongoing record of the issues. Let me give you a concrete example: A few years
ago, the engineers responsible for our desktops were operating on the theory that customers
really wanted performance from these products—the faster the better. But what the
customers actually said at the Platinum Councils was, “Yeah, performance, that’s okay. But
what I really want is a stable product that doesn’t change. Because if I’m trying to run a bank
or an airline, I don’t care if it’s 2% faster or 3% slower. What really matters is stability.” So our
engineers thought one thing, the customers thought another thing. It took the direct feedback
from the Platinum Councils to spotlight this failure to communicate. We responded by
building product with intergenerational consistency over many years. The same feedback has
helped shape the creation of our brands. For both our desktop and notebook businesses, we
created different brands designed to deliver greater stability to corporate customers, as
opposed to the fast technology changes that consumers demand.
Most of the managerial challenges at Dell Computer have to do with what we call velocity—
speeding the pace of every element of our business. Life cycles in our business are measured
in months, not years, and if you don’t move fast, you’re out of the game. Managing velocity is
about managing information—using a constant flow of information to drive operating
practices, from the performance measures we track to how we work with our suppliers.
Performance Metrics. At Dell, we use the balance sheet and the fundamentals of the P&L on a
monthly basis as tools to manage operations. From the balance sheet, we track three cash-
flow measures very closely. We look at weekly updates of how many days of inventory we
have, broken out by product component. We can then work closely with our suppliers so we
end up with the right inventory. When it’s not quite right, we can use our direct-sales model
to steer customers toward comparable products that we do have. So we use inventory
information to work both the front and back ends at the same time.
The direct model turned out to have other benefits that even Michael Dell couldn’t have
anticipated when he founded his company. “You actually get to have a relationship with the
customer,” he explains. “And that creates valuable information, which, in turn, allows us to
leverage our relationships with both suppliers and customers. Couple that information with
technology, and you have the infrastructure to revolutionize the fundamental business
models of major global companies.”
In this interview with HBR editor-at-large Joan Magretta, Michael Dell describes how his
company is using technology and information to blur the traditional boundaries in the value
chain among suppliers, manufacturers, and end users. In so doing, Dell Computer is evolving
in a direction that Michael Dell calls virtual integration. The individual pieces of the strategy—
customer focus, supplier partnerships, mass customization, just-in-time manufacturing—may all be familiar. But Michael Dell’s insight into how to combine them is highly innovative:
technology is enabling coordination across company boundaries to achieve new levels of
efficiency and productivity, as well as extraordinary returns to investors. Virtual integration
harnesses the economic benefits of two very different business models. It offers the
advantages of a tightly coordinated supply chain that have traditionally come through
vertical integration. At the same time, it benefits from the focus and specialization that drive
virtual corporations. Virtual integration, as Michael Dell envisions it, has the potential to
achieve both coordination and focus. If it delivers on that promise, it may well become a new
organizational model for the information age.
How has Dell pioneered a new business model within the computer industry?
If you look back to the industry’s inception, the founding companies essentially had to create
all the components themselves. They had to manufacture disk drives and memory chips and
application software; all the various pieces of the industry had to be vertically integrated
within one firm.
So the companies that were the stars ten years ago, the Digital Equipments of this world, had
to build massive structures to produce everything a computer needed. They had no choice
but to become expert in a wide array of components, some of which had nothing to do with
creating value for the customer.
As the industry grew, more specialized companies developed to produce specific
components. That opened up the opportunity to create a business that was far more focused
and efficient. As a small start-up, Dell couldn’t afford to create every piece of the value chain.
Consider a component like a graphics chip. Five or ten years ago, a whole bunch of companies
in the personal computer industry were trying to create their own graphics chips. Now, if
you’ve got a race with 20 players that are all vying to produce the fastest graphics chip in the
world, do you want to be the twenty-first horse, or do you want to evaluate the field of 20 and
pick the best one?
It’s a pretty simple strategy, but at the time it went against the dominant, “engineering-
centric” view of the industry. The IBMs and Compaqs and HPs subscribed to a “we-have-to-
develop-everything” view of the world. If you weren’t doing component assembly, you
weren’t a real computer company. It was like a rite of passage. You somehow proved your
who just fixed your computer?” The vast majority think that person works for us, which is
just great. That’s part of virtual integration.
Aren’t you just outsourcing your after-sales service? Is what you’re describing fundamentally
different from outsourcing?
Outsourcing, at least in the IT world, is almost always a way to get rid of a problem a company
hasn’t been able to solve itself. The classic case is the company with 2,000 people in the IT
department. Nobody knows what they do, and nobody knows why they do it. The solution—
outsource IT to a service provider, and hopefully they’ll fix it. But if you look at what happens
five years later, it’s not necessarily a pretty picture.
That’s not what we’re doing at all. We focus on how we can coordinate our activities to create
the most value for customers.
With our service providers, we’re working to set quality measures and, more important, to
build data linkages that let us see in real time how we’re doing—when parts are dispatched,
for instance, or how long it takes to respond to a request for service. We look at our business
and see, for example, that over the next ten years we are going to be making lots of notebook
computers. Dell might need 20 million flat-panel displays, and some years there will be more
demand than supply. Other years, there will be more supply than demand. A few companies
are currently making multibillion-dollar investments in the manufacture of these displays.
So we cook up a little deal where the supplier agrees to meet 25% of our volume requirements
for displays, and because of the long-term commitment we make to them, we’ll get our
displays year in and year out, even when there’s more demand than supply. The supplier
effectively becomes our partner. They assign their engineers to our design team, and we start
to treat them as if they were part of the company. For example, when we launch a new
product, their engineers are stationed right in our plants. If a customer calls in with a
problem, we’ll stop shipping product while they fix design flaws in real time.
Figuring out how many partners we need has been a process of trial and error. You learn
when you operate on the cutting edge of technology that things don’t always work as
planned. The rule we follow is to have as few partners as possible. And they will last as long as
they maintain their leadership in technology and quality. This isn’t like the automobile
business, where you find a tire supplier that you will probably stick with forever. Where the
technology is fairly stable—in monitors, for example—we expect our partnerships to last a
long time. Others will be more volatile. But regardless of how long these relationships last,
virtual integration means you’re basically stitching together a business with partners that are
treated as if they’re inside the company. You’re sharing information in a real-time fashion.
We tell our suppliers exactly what our daily production requirements are. So it’s not, “Well,
every two weeks deliver 5,000 to this warehouse, and we’ll put them on the shelf, and then
we’ll take them off the shelf.” It’s, “Tomorrow morning we need 8,562, and deliver them to
door number seven by 7 a.m.”I think about it this way: Assets collect risks around them in one form or another. Inventory is
one risk, and accounts receivable is another risk. In our case—with 70% of our sales going to
large corporate customers—accounts receivable isn’t hard to manage because companies like
Goldman Sachs and Microsoft and Oracle tend to be able to pay their bills. But in the
computer industry, inventory can actually be a pretty massive risk because if the cost of
materials goes down 50% a year and you have two or three months of inventory versus 11
days, you’ve got a big cost disadvantage. And you’re vulnerable to product transitions, when
you can get stuck with obsolete inventory.
nventory velocity is one of a handful of key performance measures we watch very closely. It
focuses us on working with our suppliers to keep reducing inventory and increasing speed.
With a supplier like Sony, which makes very good, reliable monitors, we figure there’s no
need for us to have any inventory at all. We are confident in putting the Dell name on them,
and they work fine. We don’t even take these monitors out of the box to test them because
we’ve gotten them to under 1,000 defects per million. So what’s the point in having a monitor
put on a truck to Austin, Texas, and then taken off the truck and sent on a little tour around
the warehouse, only to be put back on another truck? That’s just a big waste of time and
money, unless we get our jollies from touching monitors, which we don’t.
So we went to Sony and said, “Hey, we’re going to buy two or three million of these monitors
this year. Why don’t we just pick them up every day as we need them?” At first, it’s a little
confusing to the suppliers because you’re saying, “Now listen carefully. If you will help us get
your product from the end of your line to our customer faster, we won’t have any in our
warehouse.” And the suppliers look at you like you’re crazy and not making any sense.
They’re used to delivering in larger quantities, so at first they think this means you’re going to
buy less from them. And then the lightbulb goes on, and they realize we’ll be buying more
because we’ll be taking it faster.We tell Airborne Express or UPS to come to Austin and pick up 10,000 computers a day and go
over to the Sony factory in Mexico and pick up the corresponding number of monitors. Then
while we’re all sleeping, they match up the computers and the monitors, and deliver them to
the customer. Of course, this requires sophisticated data exchange. Most people are familiar with the way a
company like Black & Decker uses information links with the thousands of retailers that sell
its products. When a customer in Omaha buys a drill from his local hardware store, the system
immediately tells Black & Decker to send another unit of that particular drill to that particular
store. So their system has to replenish supply, unit by unit, to thousands of outlets. From the
supplier’s point of view, Dell is dramatically simpler. Our orders are typically for thousands of
units, and they need to go to only one of three manufacturing centers: Austin, Ireland, and
Malaysia. It’s almost ideal from a supplier standpoint because we have real-time information
on what the demand is, and all the supplier has to do is get the product to us.
And because we build to our customers’ order, typically, with just five or six days of lead
time, suppliers don’t have to worry about sell-through. We only maintain a few days—in some
cases a few hours—of raw materials on hand. We communicate inventory levels and
replenishment needs regularly—with some vendors, hourly. The typical case in our industry is the factory building 10,000 units a day, day in and day out.
First the machines stack up in the warehouse, and then they stack up in the channel. And all

Yes, that’s right. The idea is to use technology to free people up to solve more complicated
problems. For example, a customer like MCI can access our internal support tools on-line in
the same way our own technical-support teams do, saving time and money on both sides.
They simply go to dell.com, enter some information about their system, and they have
immediate access to the same information that we use at Dell to help customers. These tools
are used by internal help-desk groups at large companies as well as by individuals.
We’ve developed customized intranet sites called Premier Pages for well over 200 of our
largest global customers. These exist securely within the customers’ firewalls, and they give
them direct access to purchasing and technical information about the specific configurations
they buy from us. One of our customers, for example, allows its 50,000 employees to view
and select products on-line. They use the Premier Page as an interactive catalog of all the
configurations the company authorizes; employees can then price and order the PC they
want. They are happy to have some choice, and Dell and the customer are both happy to
eliminate the paperwork and sales time normally associated with corporate purchasing. That
frees our salespeople to play a more consultative role.
We also have developed tools to help customers set up their own customized versions of
dell.com. There are about 7,000 of these to date.
How else do you stay close to your customers? 
In these meetings, our senior technologists share their views on where the technology is
heading and lay out road maps of product plans over the next two years. There are also
breakout sessions and working groups in which our engineering teams focus on specific
product areas and talk about how to solve problems that may not necessarily have anything
to do with the commercial relationship with Dell. For example, Is leasing better than buying?
or How do you manage the transition to Windows NT? or How do you manage a field force of
notebook computers? People in businesses as dissimilar as Unilever and ICI can learn from each other because,
amazingly, they have very similar problems when it comes to PCs. And we send not only our
top technologists and engineers but also the real engineers, the people who usually don’t get
out to talk to customers because they’re too busy developing products. All of our senior
executives from around the company participate, spending time with the customer, listening
to how we’re doing. The ratio is about one Dell person to one customer. At our last session,
we had about 100 customers. And that helps us, as well, with our own demand forecasting. So we’re helping each other in
important ways. We hire a lot of people from other companies in the industry, and they tell us
that these meetings are unique.
Do you spend a significant amount of your time at these meetings?
I spend three days at each of them. They’re great events. In the normal course of our
business, I have lots of opportunity to talk to customers one on one, but there is something
much more powerful about this kind of forum. Customers tend to speak more openly when
they’re with their peers and they know we’re there and we’re listening.
At every Platinum Council, we review what they told us last time and what we did about it.
We keep an ongoing record of the issues. Let me give you a concrete example: A few years
ago, the engineers responsible for our desktops were operating on the theory that customers
really wanted performance from these products—the faster the better. But what the
customers actually said at the Platinum Councils was, “Yeah, performance, that’s okay. But
what I really want is a stable product that doesn’t change. Because if I’m trying to run a bank
or an airline, I don’t care if it’s 2% faster or 3% slower. What really matters is stability.” So our
engineers thought one thing, the customers thought another thing. It took the direct feedback
from the Platinum Councils to spotlight this failure to communicate. We responded by
building product with intergenerational consistency over many years. The same feedback has
helped shape the creation of our brands. For both our desktop and notebook businesses, we
created different brands designed to deliver greater stability to corporate customers, as
opposed to the fast technology changes that consumers demand.
Most of the managerial challenges at Dell Computer have to do with what we call velocity—
speeding the pace of every element of our business. Life cycles in our business are measured
in months, not years, and if you don’t move fast, you’re out of the game. Managing velocity is
about managing information—using a constant flow of information to drive operating
practices, from the performance measures we track to how we work with our suppliers.
Performance Metrics. At Dell, we use the balance sheet and the fundamentals of the P&L on a
monthly basis as tools to manage operations. From the balance sheet, we track three cash-
flow measures very closely. We look at weekly updates of how many days of inventory we
have, broken out by product component. We can then work closely with our suppliers so we
end up with the right inventory. When it’s not quite right, we can use our direct-sales model
to steer customers toward comparable products that we do have. So we use inventory
information to work both the front and back ends at the same time.
The direct model turned out to have other benefits that even Michael Dell couldn’t have
anticipated when he founded his company. “You actually get to have a relationship with the
customer,” he explains. “And that creates valuable information, which, in turn, allows us to
leverage our relationships with both suppliers and customers. Couple that information with
technology, and you have the infrastructure to revolutionize the fundamental business
models of major global companies.”
In this interview with HBR editor-at-large Joan Magretta, Michael Dell describes how his
company is using technology and information to blur the traditional boundaries in the value
chain among suppliers, manufacturers, and end users. In so doing, Dell Computer is evolving
in a direction that Michael Dell calls virtual integration. The individual pieces of the strategy—
customer focus, supplier partnerships, mass customization, just-in-time manufacturing—may all be familiar. But Michael Dell’s insight into how to combine them is highly innovative:
technology is enabling coordination across company boundaries to achieve new levels of
efficiency and productivity, as well as extraordinary returns to investors. Virtual integration
harnesses the economic benefits of two very different business models. It offers the
advantages of a tightly coordinated supply chain that have traditionally come through
vertical integration. At the same time, it benefits from the focus and specialization that drive
virtual corporations. Virtual integration, as Michael Dell envisions it, has the potential to
achieve both coordination and focus. If it delivers on that promise, it may well become a new
organizational model for the information age.
How has Dell pioneered a new business model within the computer industry?
If you look back to the industry’s inception, the founding companies essentially had to create
all the components themselves. They had to manufacture disk drives and memory chips and
application software; all the various pieces of the industry had to be vertically integrated
within one firm.
So the companies that were the stars ten years ago, the Digital Equipments of this world, had
to build massive structures to produce everything a computer needed. They had no choice
but to become expert in a wide array of components, some of which had nothing to do with
creating value for the customer.
As the industry grew, more specialized companies developed to produce specific
components. That opened up the opportunity to create a business that was far more focused
and efficient. As a small start-up, Dell couldn’t afford to create every piece of the value chain.
Consider a component like a graphics chip. Five or ten years ago, a whole bunch of companies
in the personal computer industry were trying to create their own graphics chips. Now, if
you’ve got a race with 20 players that are all vying to produce the fastest graphics chip in the
world, do you want to be the twenty-first horse, or do you want to evaluate the field of 20 and
pick the best one?
It’s a pretty simple strategy, but at the time it went against the dominant, “engineering-
centric” view of the industry. The IBMs and Compaqs and HPs subscribed to a “we-have-to-
develop-everything” view of the world. If you weren’t doing component assembly, you
weren’t a real computer company. It was like a rite of passage. You somehow proved your
who just fixed your computer?” The vast majority think that person works for us, which is
just great. That’s part of virtual integration.
Aren’t you just outsourcing your after-sales service? Is what you’re describing fundamentally
different from outsourcing?
Outsourcing, at least in the IT world, is almost always a way to get rid of a problem a company
hasn’t been able to solve itself. The classic case is the company with 2,000 people in the IT
department. Nobody knows what they do, and nobody knows why they do it. The solution—
outsource IT to a service provider, and hopefully they’ll fix it. But if you look at what happens
five years later, it’s not necessarily a pretty picture.
That’s not what we’re doing at all. We focus on how we can coordinate our activities to create
the most value for customers.
With our service providers, we’re working to set quality measures and, more important, to
build data linkages that let us see in real time how we’re doing—when parts are dispatched,
for instance, or how long it takes to respond to a request for service. We look at our business
and see, for example, that over the next ten years we are going to be making lots of notebook
computers. Dell might need 20 million flat-panel displays, and some years there will be more
demand than supply. Other years, there will be more supply than demand. A few companies
are currently making multibillion-dollar investments in the manufacture of these displays.
So we cook up a little deal where the supplier agrees to meet 25% of our volume requirements
for displays, and because of the long-term commitment we make to them, we’ll get our
displays year in and year out, even when there’s more demand than supply. The supplier
effectively becomes our partner. They assign their engineers to our design team, and we start
to treat them as if they were part of the company. For example, when we launch a new
product, their engineers are stationed right in our plants. If a customer calls in with a
problem, we’ll stop shipping product while they fix design flaws in real time.
Figuring out how many partners we need has been a process of trial and error. You learn
when you operate on the cutting edge of technology that things don’t always work as
planned. The rule we follow is to have as few partners as possible. And they will last as long as
they maintain their leadership in technology and quality. This isn’t like the automobile
business, where you find a tire supplier that you will probably stick with forever. Where the
technology is fairly stable—in monitors, for example—we expect our partnerships to last a
long time. Others will be more volatile. But regardless of how long these relationships last,
virtual integration means you’re basically stitching together a business with partners that are
treated as if they’re inside the company. You’re sharing information in a real-time fashion.
We tell our suppliers exactly what our daily production requirements are. So it’s not, “Well,
every two weeks deliver 5,000 to this warehouse, and we’ll put them on the shelf, and then
we’ll take them off the shelf.” It’s, “Tomorrow morning we need 8,562, and deliver them to
door number seven by 7 a.m.”I think about it this way: Assets collect risks around them in one form or another. Inventory is
one risk, and accounts receivable is another risk. In our case—with 70% of our sales going to
large corporate customers—accounts receivable isn’t hard to manage because companies like
Goldman Sachs and Microsoft and Oracle tend to be able to pay their bills. But in the
computer industry, inventory can actually be a pretty massive risk because if the cost of
materials goes down 50% a year and you have two or three months of inventory versus 11
days, you’ve got a big cost disadvantage. And you’re vulnerable to product transitions, when
you can get stuck with obsolete inventory.
nventory velocity is one of a handful of key performance measures we watch very closely. It
focuses us on working with our suppliers to keep reducing inventory and increasing speed.
With a supplier like Sony, which makes very good, reliable monitors, we figure there’s no
need for us to have any inventory at all. We are confident in putting the Dell name on them,
and they work fine. We don’t even take these monitors out of the box to test them because
we’ve gotten them to under 1,000 defects per million. So what’s the point in having a monitor
put on a truck to Austin, Texas, and then taken off the truck and sent on a little tour around
the warehouse, only to be put back on another truck? That’s just a big waste of time and
money, unless we get our jollies from touching monitors, which we don’t.
So we went to Sony and said, “Hey, we’re going to buy two or three million of these monitors
this year. Why don’t we just pick them up every day as we need them?” At first, it’s a little
confusing to the suppliers because you’re saying, “Now listen carefully. If you will help us get
your product from the end of your line to our customer faster, we won’t have any in our
warehouse.” And the suppliers look at you like you’re crazy and not making any sense.
They’re used to delivering in larger quantities, so at first they think this means you’re going to
buy less from them. And then the lightbulb goes on, and they realize we’ll be buying more
because we’ll be taking it faster.We tell Airborne Express or UPS to come to Austin and pick up 10,000 computers a day and go
over to the Sony factory in Mexico and pick up the corresponding number of monitors. Then
while we’re all sleeping, they match up the computers and the monitors, and deliver them to
the customer. Of course, this requires sophisticated data exchange. Most people are familiar with the way a
company like Black & Decker uses information links with the thousands of retailers that sell
its products. When a customer in Omaha buys a drill from his local hardware store, the system
immediately tells Black & Decker to send another unit of that particular drill to that particular
store. So their system has to replenish supply, unit by unit, to thousands of outlets. From the
supplier’s point of view, Dell is dramatically simpler. Our orders are typically for thousands of
units, and they need to go to only one of three manufacturing centers: Austin, Ireland, and
Malaysia. It’s almost ideal from a supplier standpoint because we have real-time information
on what the demand is, and all the supplier has to do is get the product to us.
And because we build to our customers’ order, typically, with just five or six days of lead
time, suppliers don’t have to worry about sell-through. We only maintain a few days—in some
cases a few hours—of raw materials on hand. We communicate inventory levels and
replenishment needs regularly—with some vendors, hourly. The typical case in our industry is the factory building 10,000 units a day, day in and day out.
First the machines stack up in the warehouse, and then they stack up in the channel. And all
of a sudden, the guy at the end of the chain hollers, “Whoa, hey, we’ve got too many of these.
Everybody stop!” And the order to stop flows back through the chain until it reaches every
component supplier. It’s literally stop and start, because if you have a 90-day lag between the
point of demand and the point of supply, you’re going to have a lot of inefficiency in the
process. And the more inventory and time you have, the more variability, and the more
problems.In our industry, there’s a lot of what I call bad hygiene. Companies stuff the channel to get rid
of old inventory and to meet short-term financial objectives. We think our approach is better.
We substitute information for inventory and ship only when we have real demand from real
end customers.
How does the direct model benefit your suppliers?
We can go to Sony and say, “We’re going to be pulling monitors from you in a very consistent,
predictable way because the distance between the demand and the source of supply is totally
shrunk.” The longer that distance, the more intermediary channels you add, the less likely it
is you will have good information about demand—so you will end up with more variability,
more inventory, higher costs, and more risk.
Another factor that helps keep our demand for computers level is the mix of customers we
serve. We don’t have any customer that represents more than 1% to 2% of our revenues. One
week Exxon is buying, the next week Shell is buying, the next week Ford is buying. But all
companies don’t decide in unison, “Well, this week we’re going to buy, next week we’re not.”
You mention your customer mix. Does the direct model imply a particular customer strategy?
When you’re trying to target profitable segments, averages obscure a lot, and aggregate
financial statements are pretty meaningless. Our approach to segmentation is to take really
big numbers and “de-average” them. Until you look inside and understand what’s going on
by business, by customer, by geography, you don’t know anything. This is a lesson we learned
the hard way. We incorrectly entered the retail business in 1989, thinking that our direct
business wouldn’t grow enough, and went into computer superstores and warehouse clubs.
But when we really started to understand the segment’s profitability, we realized we’d made
a mistake, and so we exited.For years, we didn’t actively pursue the consumer market because we couldn’t reach our
profit objectives. So we let our competitors introduce machines with rock-bottom prices and
zero margins. We figured they could be the ones to teach consumers about PCs while we
focused our efforts on more profitable segments. And then, because we’re direct and can see
who is buying what, we noticed something interesting. The industry’s average selling price to
consumers was going down, but ours was going up. Consumers who were now buying their
second or third machines—who wanted the most powerful machines and needed less
handholding—were coming to us. And without focusing on it in a significant way, we had a
billion-dollar consumer business that was profitable. So we decided in 1997 that it was time
to dedicate a group to serving that segment.
Fast-Cycle Segmentation Dell’s rapid growth in recent years has been accompanied by ever
finer cuts at customer segmentation. This is an important element of Dell’s virtual integration
with customers. The finer the segmentation, the better able Dell is to forecast what its
customers are going to need and when. Dell then coordinates the flow of that strategic
information all the way back to its suppliers, effectively substituting information for
inventory.Segmentation gets us closer to them. It allows us to understand their needs in a really deep
way. This closeness gives us access to information that’s absolutely critical to our strategy. It
helps us forecast what they’re going to need and when. And good forecasts are the key to
keeping our costs down.We turn our inventory over 30 times per year. If you look at the complexity and the diversity
of our product line, there’s no way we could do that unless we had credible information about
what the customer is actually buying. It’s a key part of why rivals have had great difficulty
competing with Dell. It’s not just that we sell direct, it’s also our ability to forecast demand—
it’s both the design of the product and the way the information from the customer flows all
the way through manufacturing to our suppliers. If you don’t have that tight linkage—the
kind of coordination of information that used to be possible only in vertically integrated
companies—then trying to manage to 11 days of inventory would be insane. We simply
couldn’t do it without customers who work with us as partners.
We see forecasting as a critical sales skill. We teach our sales-account managers to lead
customers through a discussion of their future PC needs. We’ll walk a customer through every
department of his company, asking him to designate which needs are certain and which are
contingent. And when they’re contingent on some event, the salesperson will know what that
event is so he can follow up. We can do this with our large accounts, which make up the bulk
of our business. With smaller customers, we have real-time information about what they’re
buying from our direct telephone salespeople. And we can also steer them in real time, on the
phone, toward configurations that are available, so this is another way we can fine-tune the
balance between supply and demand. It’s part of it. There are so many information links between us and our customers. For
example, we can help large global customers manage their total purchase of PCs by selling
them a standard product. Then when the guy whose computer isn’t working calls in from
Singapore, the IT people don’t have to spend the first 30 minutes just figuring out what
configuration of hardware and software he’s using. Selling direct allows us to keep track of
the company’s total PC purchases, country by country—and that’s valuable information we
can feed back to them. We sometimes know more about a customer’s operations than they do
themselves. Close customer relationships have allowed us to dramatically extend the value we deliver to
our customers. Today we routinely load the customer’s software in our factory. Eastman
Chemical, for example, has their own unique mix of software, some of it licensed from
Microsoft, some of it they’ve written themselves, some of it having to do with the way their
network works. Normally, they would get their PCs, take them out of the box, and then some
guy carrying a walkie-talkie and diskettes and CD-ROMs would come to each employee’s desk
to hook the system up and load all that software. Typically, this takes an hour or two—and
costs $200 to $300—and it’s a nuisance.
Our solution was to create a massive network in our factory with high-speed, 100-megabit
Ethernet. We’ll load Eastman Chemical’s software onto a huge Dell server. Then when a
machine comes down the assembly line and says, “I’m an Eastman Chemical analyst
workstation, configuration number 14,” all of a sudden a few hundred megabytes of data
come rushing through the network and onto the workstation’s hard disk, just as part of the
progressive build through our factory. If the customer wants, we can put an asset tag with the
company’s logo on the machine, and we can keep an electronic register of the customer’s
assets. That’s a lot easier than the customer sending some guy around on a thankless mission,
placing asset tags on computers when he can find them. What happens to the money our customer is saving? They get to keep most of it. We could
say, “Well, it costs you $300 to do it, so we’ll charge you $250.” But instead we charge $15 or
$20, and we make our product and our service much more valuable. It also means we’re not
going to be just your PC vendor anymore. We’re going to be your IT department for PCs.
Boeing, for example, has 100,000 Dell PCs, and we have 30 people that live at Boeing, and if
you look at the things we’re doing for them or for other customers, we don’t look like a
supplier, we look more like Boeing’s PC department. We become intimately involved in
planning their PC needs and the configuration of their network.
It’s not that we make these decisions by ourselves. They’re certainly using their own people
to get the best answer for the company. But the people working on PCs together, both from
Dell and Boeing, understand the needs in a very intimate way. They’re right there living it and
breathing it, as opposed to the typical vendor who says, “Here are your computers. See you
later.”
We’ve always visited clients, but now some of our accounts are large enough to justify a
dedicated on-site team. Remember, a lot of companies have far more complex problems to
deal with than PC purchasing and servicing. They can’t wait to get somebody else to take care
of that so they can worry about more strategic issues.
So some of your coordination with customers is made possible through technology, but
there’s still a good measure of old-fashioned, face-to-face human contact?
Yes, that’s right. The idea is to use technology to free people up to solve more complicated
problems. For example, a customer like MCI can access our internal support tools on-line in
the same way our own technical-support teams do, saving time and money on both sides.
